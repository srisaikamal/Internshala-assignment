In a group setting, a Version Control System, or VCS, isn\u2019t something for leisure, it\u2019s a requirement.</p>\n<p align="left">Keeping track of who is deploying code, exactly what changes are being made, and having the capability to stop a bug from being deployed to a live product can make or break a project. In this article, we take a closer look at two of the most popular hosting options available today &#8211; GitLab and GitHub.</p>\n<p align="left"><b>What is Git?</b></p>\n<p align="left">Git is a Version Control System (VCS) developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux. A VCS is vital to development projects requiring more than one developer as it simplifies keeping track of changes to code. Git is a free and open-sourced software, which is largely why it is so popular.</p>\n<p align="left">Git uses a data structure (called a repository) to store information designed to manage a set of files as they change over time during development.</p>\n<p align="left">In contrast to other version control systems, which store the full version history of the code in one place, Git is a <i>distributed VCS</i> (DVCS). Here, each developer&#8217;s copy of the code functions as an exclusive repository that contains the entire history of all changes made.</p>\n<p align="left">This opens up the opportunity to rollback any code to the last working version with ease.</p>\n<p align="left"><b>What is GitHub?</b></p>\n<p align="left"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.cloudloid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/What-is-GitHub.jpg?ssl=1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-151" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.cloudloid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/What-is-GitHub.jpg?resize=680%2C389&#038;ssl=1" alt="What is GitHub?" width="680" height="389" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>\n<p align="left">GitHub is a web-based Git repository manager owned by Microsoft that helps facilitate team collaboration. With around 37 million users (which is a constantly growing figure) and over 100 million repositories (about 27 million public repositories), its popularity cannot be ignored. Its massive community is highly active and supportive.</p>\n<p align="left">On the platform side of GitHub, you can assign tasks, perform reviews, and brainstorm ideas in GitHub via pull requests. While changes happen to your repository, you can use diffs, which are useful tools to compare different versions of source code.</p>\n<p align="left">With a growing team, code accessibility becomes more important with rising security needs. In GitHub, branch permissions define who can push to a specific branch. Repositories can be set to expect to pull request reviews and status checks, thus facilitating the reduction of errors.</p>\n<p align="left">GitHub is designed to be utilized by developer teams of all sizes. Unsurprisingly, there are a number of integrated project management features such as assignees, cards, notes, milestones, and tasks.</p>\n<p align="left">For maximizing convenience, GitHub offers a great desktop application for easily managing repos on your local device, as well as for pushing changes without opening your browser. Further, you can choose from any number of 3<sup>rd</sup> party add-ons if you\u2019re looking for even greater insight and control into existing projects.</p>\n<p align="left"><b>What is GitLab?</b></p>\n<p align="left"><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.cloudloid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Gitlab.jpg?ssl=1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-152" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.cloudloid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Gitlab.jpg?resize=680%2C453&#038;ssl=1" alt="Gitlab" width="680" height="453" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>\n<p align="left">GitLab is a also web-based Git repository manager aimed at facilitating team collaboration. The platform contains a Wiki and an issue tracker amongst other features.</p>\n<p align="left">GitLab supports <i>shared runners</i> so you can exploit the built-in Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). Commit graph and reporting tools give additional details about the work of collaborators.</p>\n<p align="left"><i>Milestones</i> in GitLab offer a way to track issues and merge requests created to attain a high-level goal. You can create and manage milestones across projects.</p>\n<p align="left">These can be imported from Google Code, Bitbucket, Gitea, GitHub, and any other git URLs. Otherwise, if you intend to export your project to other platforms, GitLab offers complete unrestricted access to your data.</p>\n<p align="left">When dealing with multiple issues, you can directly set their status, assignee, or milestone at the same time. You can also relocate issues between projects while retaining all links, history, and comments.</p>\n<p align="left">If you\u2019re creating new branches from individual issues, you\u2019ll be able to hold onto the issue number and title, thus making your workflow more efficient while making it easier to work with other collaborators.</p>\n<p align="left">GitLab conveniently assigns community contributions by allocating patches from upstream maintainers in a branch. This reduces the back and forth or repetitions that would happen otherwise.</p>\n<p align="left"><b>Github Pricing</b></p>\n<p align="left">Github offers both free and paid plans. Their free plan offers unlimited users, unlimited public and private repositories, with up to 500 MB of storage.</p>\n<p align="left">Since May of 2020, private repositories are no longer limited to 3 collaborators, that is, GitHub is now free for teams. Teams in need of advanced features (like code owners), or personalized support can upgrade to one of the paid plans with details found here: <a href="https://github.com/pricing"><span style="color: #000000;"><u>https://github.com/pricing</u></span></a></p>\n<p align="left">Larger teams can contact the sales department to get an offer for GitHub One. It includes the same features as the GitHub Enterprise plan, plus actionable metrics, continuous learning, and 24/7 support.</p>\n<p align="left"><strong>Gitlab Pricing</strong></p>\n<p align="left">Like GitHub, you can either use the free or paid plans hosted on GitLab.com, SaaS hosted by GitLab, or host your own instance.</p>\n<p align="left">The free edition comes with unlimited private and public projects, unlimited contributors, plus 2,000 CI pipeline minutes monthly. Further information can be found here: <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/" rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><u>https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/</u></span></a></p>\n<p align="left"><a name="_gjdgxs"></a>Well, the answer is: that depends. Both platforms offer issues and bug tracking capabilities, built-in CI and CD, Continuous Delivery toolsets, and a vast as well as the active support community.</p>\n<p align="left">Solo developers or smaller teams can try out both and decide which one suits them best. The same goes for enterprise-level features: larger teams can find enterprise settings and plans on GitLab as well as GitHub.</p>\n',

It is a client-side language. It uses the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate the web page in response to the events/user input. It defines the behavior of the web page.</p>\n<p>Using the technique called AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), one can get, post, update, and delete data without reloading the page. The world&#8217;s topmost programming language which stands 3rd Position according to PyPI Index May 2020. JavaScript is initially made for making websites interactive. But now, JavaScript is used everywhere in software development.</p>\n<p>React Native for Mobile app development, Electron.Js for Desktop development, Node Js for Back end and React, Angular for Front-end. JavaScript is the must learn programming language if you are going for making a career as a Web Developer.</p>\n<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Node_Js"></span>Node Js<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>\n<p>Node js is an open-source Javascript run time environment for executing JavsScript out of the browser. It&#8217;s built on <strong>chrome&#8217;s V8 JavaScript Engine</strong>. Node Js is used to build back end applications and application programming interfaces (APIs).</p>\n<p>Initially, JavaScript is only used for front-end development but with the help of Node Js, JavaScript can be used for Server-side scripting. Building a Full Stack application made easy with JavaScript. It&#8217;s easy to learn, free to use and it&#8217;s cross-platform.</p>\n<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="What_is_Heroku"></span>What is Heroku?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>\n<p>Heroku is a cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) that provides small Linux containers called <strong>Dynos</strong>. Heroku helps you to deploy, manage your web app with ease. You don&#8217;t need to struggle to configure your webservers or to hire a DevOps engineer.</p>\n<p>Heroku cloud is fully managed by Heroku&#8217;s team, so you can fully focus on your workflow instead of struggling with the server. Heroku supports multiple programming languages like Python, Java, Go, Php, etc&#8230; Heroku provides <a href="https://www.cloudloid.com/heroku-toolbelt/"><strong>Heroku Toolbelt or Heroku CLI</strong></a> for deploying and managing apps.</p>\n<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Why_Heroku_for_Node_Js"></span>Why Heroku for Node Js<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>\n<p>Heroku is for developers who are looking to handle their servers without a DevOps engineer. Heroku setup&#8217;s everything for you to deploy your app over their server. Instead of paying a huge amount to DevOps engineer, with a small amount, you can run a high scalable app on Heroku.</p>\n<p>You can deploy the Node js app for production in just a few minutes without any server setup. The process is as easy as pushing your code to GitHub. That&#8217;s why most of the developers are going towards Heroku to deploy their apps as it&#8217;s very easy to deploy.</p>\n<p>Once you push your code to Heroku cloud, Heroku takes the remaining part. It just seconds, it&#8217;ll deploy your app to Heroku cloud with a sub-domain. later you can connect with your own domain name with the app.</p>\n<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Is_Heroku_free_for_Node_Js"></span>Is Heroku free for Node Js<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>\n<p>Heroku is free for developers who are testing their applications over the cloud. Heroku is free to host any web apps made of Python, Java, Node, Go, etc&#8230;</p>\n<p>Heroku provides 550 hours of free Dyno hours which are equivalent to 22 days and these hours are renewed every month and each Dyno had <strong>512MB of Ram.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Heroku credits with 450 extra hours if you verify your account with a credit card. This is very useful for developers who are getting started with a low budget.</p>\n<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="How_to_Deploy_Node_JS_to_Production_in_Heroku_for_free"></span>How to Deploy Node JS to Production in Heroku for free<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>\n<p>Deploying your node js app won&#8217;t even take a minute.

This is best for testing your app or if your app having less traffic, this gonna be the best.</p>\n<p>Also, in Heroku free, your app will sleep within 30 minutes of inactivity. If anyone revisits again, Heroku will start the app again. This is not a big issue because the user doesn&#8217;t notice any difference when opening your app.</p>\n<p>There are lots of free addons and resources in Heroku that you can use for your app such as Postgres SQL, SendGrid, etc&#8230;</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.cloudloid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/How-to-Deploy-Node-Js-App-For-Free-in-Heroku-Dynos.png?ssl=1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-141" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.cloudloid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/How-to-Deploy-Node-Js-App-For-Free-in-Heroku-Dynos.png?resize=680%2C354&#038;ssl=1" alt="How to Deploy Node Js App For Free in Heroku" width="680" height="354" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you want to change your app to Hobby Dyno which costs 7$ a month go-to resources, click on Change Dyno type and change it to Hobby or any other higher package.</p>\n<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Wrapping_Up"></span>Wrapping Up<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>\n<p>Everything is automatic with Heroku.

Well, opening a VPS or dedicated server is easy which can be done simply using panels provided by cloud hosting providers but getting started with it might be some challenging task.</p>\n<p>You have to install your software stack in the server, web server, FTP, etc&#8230; this is complicated for beginners to work on it. Even if you follow, you may be stuck at some point. You have to google the problem, trying to solve it and again another problem.</p>\n<p>This is irritating and time-consuming. So, why don&#8217;t we use a small Linux script that will install all the required components for your PHP web app? Sounds great. What tool is that?</p>\n<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="What_is_EasyEngine"></span>What is EasyEngine:<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>\n<p>The Linux script installs the LEMP stack in your server. LEMP means Nginx, PHP, and MySQL. EasyEngine is a lightweight process that manages your server up and running. EasyEngine consumes very little memory as it works only with CLI.</p>\n<p>EasyEngine is an open-source project collection of Linux script runs on your terminal to install the software. EasyEngine is made with Python and the installation of the script is pretty simple and straight forward.</p>\n<p>EasyEngine has an installer script that installs all necessary files such as Dockers, Docker-Compose, PHP, and its modules.</p>\n<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="EasyEngine_for_WordPress"></span>EasyEngine for WordPress:<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>\n<p>Installing WordPress is very easy with a single click. Many VPS providers such as DigitalOcean, Vultr, AWS has an option to install WordPress in the server.</p>\n<p>But this process installs one WordPress site on the VPS server. But in a server, we can run unlimited websites based on the server resources.</p>\n<p>To manage and install multiple websites, we can use tools and CLI such as EasyEngine. EasyEngine setups virtual hosts when you add a new site which makes your work simpler and easier. Just you need to type in the cmd, EasyEngine setups everything for you.</p>\n<p>EasyEngine not only supports WordPress, but you can install your PHP web apps with ease. As EasyEngine comes with PHP installed, you can simply host multiple Static sites or a Dynamic PHP app.</p>\n<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Nginx_as_Web_Server"></span>Nginx as Web Server:<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>\n<p>One of the best things with EasyEngine was it makes use of <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">Nginx</a> as a Web Server. Nginx (Engine X) is a high-performance web server that can be also used for load balancing, reverser proxy. For websites with huge traffic and a huge number of concurrent users, Nginx is the best choice.</p>\n<p>Nginx uses very fewer resources and it has ability to work with low-end hardware without compromise on performance. If you are looking to host multiple WordPress websites on a single server, Nginx will give you amazing results.</p>\n<h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Why_EasyEngine"></span>Why EasyEngine?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>\n<p>There are several hosting control panels on the internet such as cPanel, Plesk, CyberPanel, centos web panel, etc&#8230; All these panels are easy to use, customizable and it comes with Web GUI panel.</p>\n<p>With these panels, you can easily set up website, manage your website using GUI web panel but the only thing is they consume most of your server resources.</p>\n<p>Yes, if you got 1GB of memory, with panels like Plesk, cPanel, Cyberpanel, you will get only 300-200 MB of free memory. All the remaining memory is used by Web Panels. You are trying to host your website, not hosting panel right&#8230;</p>\n<p>These panels are only for servers with better hardware. EasyEngine is not like that. EasyEngine doesn&#8217;t have a web panel or any other unnecessary things to host your websites.</p>\n<p>EasyEngine doesn&#8217;t even consume 300Mb of your memory. It was a very lightweight process works with CLI. Easy cmd&#8217;s that you don&#8217;t need to remember.</p>\n<p>Even beginners can work with these commands. EasyEngine provides a handbook with list of all their commands and their uses.</p>\n<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="How_to_Install_EasyEngine_on_the_Debian_server"></span>How to Install EasyEngine on the Debian server?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>\n<h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Why_Debian"></span>Why Debian?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>\n<p>Debian is a universal OS for all the different Linux distros. Most of the Linux distros are based on Debian. Ubuntu is one of it. Debian is a lightweight Linux os which requires only fewer resources. If you got low hardware for your server, Debian is the best choice.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m installing the Debian server on DigitalOcean server which costs 5$ per month which is pretty cheap than compared to shared hosting. You own the full server and you can do whatever you want, unlike shared hosting.</p>\n<p>1000 of websites are hosted in a single shared hosting server and it will be so problem for you if you are having a huge amount of traffic for your website.</p>\n<h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="My_Server_details"></span>My Server details:<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>\n<p><strong>Hosting:</strong> <a href="https://bit.ly/35lnffd">DigitalOcean</a> (I prefer DigitalOcean because it provides a <strong>100$ signup bonus with the link</strong>.)</p>\n<p><strong>OS: </strong><span class="detail-droplet-image-name">Debian 9.12 x64 (I installed on version 9.12 but you can also try with </span>10.3 x64<span class="detail-droplet-image-name">)</span></p>\n<p><strong>CPU: </strong>1 vCPUs</p>\n<p><strong>Memory &amp; SSD: </strong>1GB / 25GB Disk</p>\n<p>1GB memory is good enough for websites or blogs with 10k visitors a day. You can even host multiple websites and Nginx can handle multiple requests at a time. If you got some better hardware.</p>\n<p>Your server can handle multiple websites if your traffic is minimal. If you are looking to host high traffic websites then, min of 4GB ram is recommended.</p>\n<h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Server_Setup"></span>Server Setup:<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>\n<p>Make an account in <strong><a href="https://m.do.co/c/9b718a927067">DigitalOcean</a></strong>. If you use the above link to register, you&#8217;ll get <strong>100$ as a signup bonus.</strong> Honestly, I&#8217;ll also get a <strong>25$ referral bonus</strong> which makes this <strong>site live for 5 Months</strong>.</p>\n<p>Create a new <strong>droplet</strong> (a server) in a digital ocean and select your hardware configuration. then create your new VPS server.</p>\n<p>It will take a minute to create a droplet. You&#8217;ll get an email regarding SSH details along with the password. Connect to your server with an SSH client like Putty. One first it will show you to change your password.</p>\n<p>After you are done configuring your VPS. now it&#8217;s to install.</p>\n<h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Installation_of_EasyEngine"></span>Installation of EasyEngine:<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>\n<p>The installation of EasyEngine is pretty simple and straight forward. EasyEngine has an installer script installs everything that your server needs.</p>\n<p>Some times we might need to install Easyengine manually. if auto-installer doesn&#8217;t work.</p>\n<p><strong>Auto Installation:</strong></p>\n<p>The following command installs EasyEngine in your VPS server.</p>\n<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">wget -qO ee rt.cx/ee4 &amp;&amp; sudo bash ee</pre>\n<p>It takes a minute or 2 based on system performance. Once it&#8217;s installed you can confirm by typing</p>\n<pre>ee</pre>\n<p>It will show some list of cmd&#8217;s to use EasyEngine.</p>\n<p><strong>Manual Installation:</strong></p>\n<p>The following command installs all the dependencies required for EasyEngine to run and it installs EasyEngine</p>\n<pre>wget -O /usr/local/bin/ee https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EasyEngine/easyengine-builds/master/phar/easyengine.phar\r\nchmod +x /usr/local/bin/ee</pre>\n<p>That&#8217;s it. You&#8217;ve installed EasyEngine on your server.</p>\n<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="How_to_install_WordPress_on_EasyEngine"></span>How to install WordPress on EasyEngine:<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>\n<p>The installation of the WordPress website is also pretty simple. You don&#8217;t need to manually upload WordPress files, setup MySQL, or anything like that.</p>\n<p>Everything is done by EasyEngine with just simple commands.</p>\n<pre><code>ee site create domain.com --type=wp --cache</code></pre>\n<p>The following command installs WordPress on Domain.com with an enabling page and object cache. To connect your domain with the server. Point an\u00a0 A record with Server IP.</p>\n<p>Like that you can create multiple WordPress websites by changing domain.</p>\n<p><strong>To Enable SSL.</strong></p>\n<p>SSL or HTTPS is now recommended to every website. By default, it is not enabled. To add an SSL certificate to your website</p>\n<pre><code>ee site update domain.com --ssl=le</code></pre>\n<p>it will install a Let&#8217;s Encrypt certificate on your website.

The packet is attached with a unique Mac address and IP address. Internet packets are very small and they are transmitted over TCP/IP protocol.</p>\n<p>Whatever the data you send over the internet is converted into a group of packets which as source and destination. All the packets are routed to find the shortest distance and when it reaches the destination, the TCP/IP protocol combines the data.</p>\n<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="What_is_Packet_Loss"></span>What is Packet Loss?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>\n<p>The internet is a big cloud and if I want to send information from my computer to my friend of a different network let&#8217;s say the information is either maybe an Email or a song, etc&#8230; All the information we sent across the network or internet is broken up into Packets.</p>\n<p>The packets travel across the network and the issue is the network is very busy. Busy in the case, the network has a lot of traffic and many people are using the same network. Lots of people are using the same network for Video calls, Transferring data or Downloading and uploading data.</p>\n<p>So, the email you sent was converted into packets and traveling across the network. Due to the high amount of traffic the line has, some packets will be lost across the network.</p>\n<p>If I sent an email like this &#8220;Hi!, Please send me your resume.&#8221; It reaches the destination with the dropping of some data. let&#8217;s say the resume is removed. so how to user can understand the message?</p>\n<p>Packet loss becomes very annoying and frustrating especially when you&#8217;re trying to make some sort of business emails or calls so the fact if a colossus poor quality upset voice upset video and a cause are simply if the Internet is a very popular place to be.</p>\n<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Why_do_Packets_Drop"></span>Why do Packets Drop?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>\n<p>So TCP has all of these provisions to deal with packet loss and other failures. But why do these ever happen in the first place? Why don&#8217;t networks just be super reliable, so nothing ever gets dropped? Well, that&#8217;s not always an option.</p>\n<p>Imagine that you have two machines, Host A and Host B attached to two different fast networks. But those fast networks are connected by a slow network in the middle. Like maybe these are two offices with gigabit ethernet, and the connection between them is only 10 megabit. That&#8217;s 100 times slower.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.cloudloid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Why-do-Packets-Drop.png?ssl=1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-71" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.cloudloid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Why-do-Packets-Drop.png?resize=680%2C385&#038;ssl=1" alt="Why do Packets Drop?" width="680" height="385" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>\n<p>Then Host A tries to send a large amount of data over to Host B, let&#8217;s say a 1GB of data. Because its own network interface is very fast. Host A could transmit this data as far as its nearby router, in about 8 seconds. But that data also has to travel over this slow link, and because that&#8217;s 100 times slower, over that 10 megabit network, it&#8217;s going to take 13 minutes.</p>\n<p>Where does the data have to live in the meantime? If Host A were allowed to just push that large amount of data onto the network, in order for it to get through, this router would have to buffer it in memory and trickle it out over this slow link over the next 13 minutes.</p>\n<p>And meanwhile, nobody else on this network would be able to send anything. <span id="dd6b075d559b45cde015" class="match inexact-match" title="66% match" data-source-url="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11270-010-0473-2" data-match-num="1" data-similarity-score="66%" data-source-id="doi.org:2f1ea6d334b6b0157bb20630007cb40957030c11b4ca9b1e35262bdab1c17a9e">This link would be saturated, completely full</span>. That wouldn&#8217;t be a very good outcome.</p>\n<p>So TCP and routers don&#8217;t actually do it that way. Instead, TCP doesn&#8217;t start sending data at full blast. It starts out slowly, only increasing speed when the other end shows it can keep up by sending acknowledgments back. If packets are dropped, it slows down, and then gradually it speeds up again. And routers work with this by dropping packets if the link they&#8217;re trying to send on is too busy.</p>\n<p>The result of this is that the endpoints and the routers in the middle collaborate to move data at close to an optimal speed. But this only works because routers are willing to drop packets in order to signal congestion. And endpoints are willing to slow down in response. If the router just let everything queue up, the whole connection would eventually time out.</p>\n<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Other_Problems_for_High_Packet_Loss"></span>Other Problems for High Packet Loss:<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>\n<h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Check_your_cables"></span>Check your cables:<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>\n<p>Yes, Packet loss occurs with faulty cables, network lines. Faulty cables not only leads to packet loss but also totally ruin your entire connectivity.</p>\n<p>Poor network cables lead to slow internet, etc.\u00a0 Always check your cables for any broken links and keep upgrading your network cables.</p>\n<h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="The_heating_issue_with_your_devices"></span>The heating issue with your devices<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>\n<p>Electronics always generate heat when they are working. When they are working 24/7 without any rest, they overheated and cause low performance.</p>\n<p>This will slow down your devices, mainly router and PC. They perform too low and this causes high packet loss and also high latency or high ping.</p>\n<h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Network_Security"></span>Network Security<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>\n<p>Packets might be tempered by hackers to hack your information and sometimes these packets may loose in the network. This became a very serious issue in the age of the digital era.</p>\n<p>Attackers use different techniques to hack your data and they use it for any commercial or personal use. Some hackers use techniques like Distributed denial of service attacks to make your network down.</p>\n<p>Dos is a kind of penetration test also used by cybercriminals to down your server or a network. This leads to packet loss. To prevent this from happening, always maintain good cybersecurity practices</p>\n<h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="These_reasons_also_lead_to_Packet_loss_in_a_wired_network"></span>These reasons also lead to Packet loss in a wired network:<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Mis-configured equipment/Operator error</li>\n<li>Faulty equipment in Routers</li>\n<li>Faulty Switches</li>\n<li>Network Congestion</li>\n<li>Faulty and buggy software</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Network_Losses_in_Wireless_network"></span>Network Losses in Wireless network:<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>\n<h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Congestion"></span>Congestion<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>\n<p>When there is huge traffic in the network, packets might lose in the network.

You can check packet loss in windows, Linux, and mac.</p>\n<p>Once you are with your system open command prompt in windows or terminal in Linux and Mac. In order to ping, you have to type ping &lt;server IP&gt;, for example, ping google.com</p>\n<p>So what your PC technically doing was constantly pinging Google it&#8217;s making requests to Google and Google is responding with some data.</p>\n<pre>64 bytes from 104.18.63.36 (104.18.63.36): icmp_seq=6 ttl=58 time=155 ms\r\n--- cloudloid.com ping statistics ---\r\n6 packets transmitted, 6 received, 0% packet loss, time 5007ms\r\nrtt min/avg/max/mdev = 155.101/156.457/158.935/1.700 ms</pre>\n<p>What&#8217;s happening now you can see the reply from that&#8217;s the IP address of the Google server requesting bytes and time and TTL time is what we&#8217;re gonna focus on now.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re having packet loss you&#8217;re going to watch the time field that ranges between <strong>26 and 40</strong> absolute maximum which is a normal ping range for a good working connection especially considering I&#8217;m hardwired.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re on Wi-Fi you&#8217;re probably gonna see a <strong>ping range of like 80</strong> but a hardwired connection with good quality equipment and a gigabit switch or router your ping would be normal like in between 40.</p>\n<p>If you see <strong>0% packet loss</strong>, it&#8217;s mean there&#8217;s no packet loss from your pc to google. If you&#8217;re seeing a <strong>time response of a 180, 200, 350, 400</strong> some-more even higher you&#8217;ve got packet loss. now, what&#8217;s that high time response mean? somewhere in the connection from your computer all the way to Google servers in California or wherever they are something is wrong. It might be DDoS or wires messed up or a piece of hardware&#8217;s messed up.</p>\n<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="How_to_Fix_Packet_loss"></span>How to Fix Packet loss?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>\n<p>Now you know how to check packet loss and if you have packet loss in your network you need to fix it. but how do we fix it? How do we know where the problem occurred? Nobody knows what&#8217;s wrong on the line. The problem might be from your end like it is a wire maybe it&#8217;s something simple if it&#8217;s something on your end.</p>\n<p>If something problem on Google&#8217;s end then you need to wait until they fix it. It problem might not occur with google in most cases.</p>\n<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Fix_High_Packet_loss_using_PingPlotter"></span>Fix High Packet loss using PingPlotter.<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>\n<p><a href="https://www.pingplotter.com/">PingPlotter</a> is a network managing, troubleshooting, and diagnostics tool for detecting any issues in networks.

Set <strong>Focus to Auto. </strong>Now set the\u00a0<strong>interval </strong>to <strong>1S. </strong>It&#8217;s gonna actually make the request to Google or whatever server you can see it goes all the way from 0.5 seconds to 60 minutes it&#8217;ll make a ping 0.5 seconds can be too much for the computer or router you&#8217;re using but <strong>1 Second</strong> is very consistent.</p>\n<p>On the <strong>address bar,</strong> you have to enter the server IP or it&#8217;s addressed to ping. I would actually search for Google.com and press enter and here we can see all the steps required all the servers in between you and the final server of google.com</p>\n<p>There are tons of fields here we have a lot of information going on, you have all the IPs of all the servers, the names, the average ping, the minimum ping, the current ping, and <strong>PL (packet loss) percentage</strong>.</p>\n<p>This is what you&#8217;re going to be watching out. if any of these show up in <strong>red with a percentage</strong>, that is causing the problem in your network.</p>\n<p>Packet loss is basically imagined if I sent an email and sections and words out of the text in the email were just missing they did not get to the final destination, you got a garbled message because it&#8217;s missing information.</p>\n<p>So what have to do as your computer is resent it until it gets through which causes lag. that&#8217;s essentially what&#8217;s happening your computers having to resend the message and resend until it gets through causes lag causes delays and if you&#8217;re a video gamer it&#8217;s what&#8217;s making you miss shots.</p>\n<h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="How_to_Fix_packet_loss_now"></span>How to Fix packet loss now?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>\n<p>So let&#8217;s interpret this a little bit, so you know why you&#8217;re lagging and where is it coming from. Okay so, the first thing on this list is your computer to your router. If you&#8217;re seeing packet loss on that first line it is something relating to your computer itself the <strong>network card</strong> or the wire or the router.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s one of those, the first one getting packet loss is all you and you need to start switching that equipment at that point to figure it out, and when it stops giving packet loss that means you&#8217;ve replaced the appropriate piece of equipment.</p>\n<p>Now if it&#8217;s from the first connection to the second one which means the second one has packet loss but the first one doesn&#8217;t it is either the <strong>wire between the router</strong> and the <strong>modem</strong> or the <strong>modem itself</strong> more than likely there is a chance it could be the cable line that runs from the pole to your modem.</p>\n<p>Replace the wire first after that if that doesn&#8217;t fix it then you&#8217;re gonna want to take your modem back to your company for a replacement. Plug the new modem and check if it fixes your problem. If it doesn&#8217;t fix your problem then you have a much bigger issue. You need to call your internet service provider to come out and actually start diagnosing the lines outside your house.</p>\n<p>What if it&#8217;s the third problem? that&#8217;s the one you don&#8217;t want if the third thing on this list is the one that has packet loss and nothing else does you are going to have some serious problems.</p>\n<p>The third thing is your local head end which is a big box server inside your neighborhood or town or section of your neighborhood that serves a lot of people. Internet service providers are very reluctant to spend the money to fix those.</p>\n<p>They will when it gets out of hand with customer complaints but if you&#8217;re just the one lonely guy calling up about it they&#8217;re going to make you do so much to get that fixed. Secondly, it doesn&#8217;t even always have to be the head end sometimes it&#8217;s a connection between your house and 30 poles going all the way to the head end.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s something in between your house and that box that&#8217;s possible. If you&#8217;re the only one or only a few people are experiencing that issue that are on the head end then it&#8217;s something from your house all the way to that box. If it&#8217;s the majority of the town or the area it&#8217;s the head end and that&#8217;s gonna require the ISP to invest some money to fix and they usually don&#8217;t try to fix it.</p>\n<p>What if it&#8217;s one after the third one, that means is something on a much larger scale a bigger server that is not inherently a <strong>local service problem</strong> is having issues could be anything could be a hardware wire down power line something bigger is happening in between you and them and the server you&#8217;re trying to communicate with.</p>\n<p>Now for a problem like that, it will likely be resolved somewhere in 48 to 72 hours it&#8217;s not your problem. it&#8217;s a big enough issue that I&#8217;m sure they know about it and they&#8217;re probably working on it. So don&#8217;t be concerned with that the ones you really concerned with are the first three problems</p>\n<p>You only have to concern about your computer to the router, router to the modem, and modem to the initial head end in your town. If those three have problems you need to address it.</p>\n<p>The first two are you. the third one is your ISP company that&#8217;s pretty consistent with the ping plotter, especially if you&#8217;re you&#8217;re using a router if you&#8217;re directly connected to the modem then you would not see this first one you would only see the second and the third one which would imply that the third the second one is the issue at that point.</p>\n',

class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>\n<p>Heroku is a cloud computing company provides cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) for the developers. Unlike Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud, Heroku is fully managed. No need to install Web Server or any core software needed to run your app on the cloud.</p>\n<p>Everything is automatically done by Heroku, So you can completely focus on developing a scalable web application. You select what app you are going to deploy in Heroku (Heroku supports multiple programming languages.) Select what app you are going to deploy in Heroku i.e, Node.Js app, Php, Go, Java, Python, Ruby, etc&#8230;</p>\n<h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="What_is_Heroku"></span>What is Heroku?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>\n<p>As we already discussed some points above, Well Heroku is a cloud computing company provides a cloud Platform as a Service. Heroku is for beginners who are looking to deploy apps directly without any server setup.</p>\n<p>Heroku pricing is somewhat high. It starts from 7$ a month and it increases based on your usage. But if you are on a budget, Aws is good but you need to set up everything from scratch.</p>\n<p>In 2007, Heroku was established but later on, it was acquired by <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/" rel="nofollow">SalesForce</a>. To deploy an app in Heroku, it&#8217;s really simple as you think. No need to set up a server and install all the required things that your app needs.</p>\n<p>Select the language you are going to deploy in Heroku and push your code using Git through <strong>Heroku CLI</strong>. That&#8217;s it, your app will be live on the Heroku&#8217;s sub-domain. They also provide a free subdomain for your app or you can use your own domain for your app.</p>\n<h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Why_Heroku"></span>Why Heroku?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>\n<p>Heroku is so easy to set up and deployment of your app only takes seconds. You can create, manage, and deploy everything using the Heroku command line.</p>\n<p>Heroku Command line or CLI is the part of Heroku Toolbelt, used for managing your cloud apps in Heroku. You don&#8217;t need a DevOps engineer because everything is already managed by Heroku and you only need to focus on your app.</p>\n<h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Is_Heroku_Free"></span>Is Heroku Free?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>\n<p>Heroku is <strong>FREE</strong> for developers who are testing their applications, bots, or a blog. Some developers want to try out Heroku or any cloud services before going to a paid plan.</p>\n<p>Heroku free plan is more than enough for medium traffic applications. Heroku cloud platform works on lightweight Linux containers knows as <strong>Dynos</strong>.</p>\n<p>You get free Dynos which as <strong>512MB</strong> of <strong>Ram\u00a0</strong>and you can get up to 100 Dynos by verifying your account with a credit card. A non-verified user has fewer features when compared to the verified users.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll get 550 hours of free Dynos hours and additionally another 450 hours if you verify your account with a credit card. Your app will sleep within 30 minutes of the time of inactivity. If anyone revisits your app, the app starts and works normally.</p>\n<h4><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Heroku_for_Students_(Using_GitHub_Student_Pack)"></span>Heroku for Students (Using GitHub Student Pack)<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h4>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-47 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.cloudloid.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Heroku-for-Students-Using-GitHub-Student-Pack.png?resize=680%2C341&#038;ssl=1" alt="Heroku for Students (Using GitHub Student Pack)" width="680" height="341" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>\n<p>Students are greatly benefited from Heroku. Heroku provides lots of features for students that a normal free plan didn&#8217;t get. One thing is your <strong>app never sleeps</strong>.</p>\n<p>Your app will be fully functional until you destroy the app. Heroku provides a <strong>Hobby Dyno</strong> for students which costs 7$ a month and it comes with 10 process types.</p>\n<p>To get a Heroku student plan, sign up for <strong><a href="https://education.github.com/pack/offers" rel="nofollow">GitHub Educational Pack</a></strong>. GitHub Educational Pack is an essential took-kit for students provides a lot of tools and services a student need. One of the services is Heroku.</p>\n<p>Sign Up Heroku with the link provided by Heroku and verify your account with credit card. Once your done login with your credentials into Heroku and wait for a mail for approval.</p>\n<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="What_is_Heroku_Toolbelt"></span>What is Heroku Toolbelt?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>\n<p>Heroku Toolbelt is an open-source CLI or Command-line interface by Heroku and the project source code can be found on GitHub as (<a href="https://github.com/heroku/cli" rel="nofollow">Heroku Toolbelt or CLI</a>). Heroku Toolbelt is necessary for developers who are going to manage, create, and deploy Heroku apps.</p>\n<p>Heroku admin panel has options to create what type of app you are going to deploy and some other settings such as adding a custom domain, adding addons, metrics, etc..</p>\n<p>You cannot upload source code to the Heroku dashboard directly. To upload code, you either use GitHub repo or Git to push source code to Heroku.</p>\n<p>If your source code is already on GitHub, you can add source code to Heroku&#8217;s app simply by connecting your account with GitHub. After connecting, it show&#8217;s all the repository. Select the repository and Heroku will take care of the remaining part.</p>\n<h3><span class="ez-toc-section" id="Is_Heroku_Toolbelt_and_Heroku_CLI_different"></span>Is Heroku Toolbelt and Heroku CLI different?<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span></h3>\n<p>Most of the people things that Heroku Toolbelt and Heroku CLI are different. But both are the same. Heroku Toolbelt is formally known as Heroku CLI. and toolbelt is an older version and it&#8217;s updated to a newer version called Heroku CLI.</p>\n<p>You can control everything using Heroku Toolbelt and all the commands are not much difficult to remember.
